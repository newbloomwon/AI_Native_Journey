Colonizing Venus With Floating Cities By Nancy Atkinson - July 16, 2008 at 11:42 AM UTC | Space Exploration Seemingly, people in the space community have a tendency to push the boundaries of thought about all the possibilities that await us in the universe.  Case in point: Geoffrey Landis.  Landis is a scientist at NASA's Glenn Research Center who writes science fiction in his spare time.

## Key Facts

1. Landis is a scientist at NASA's Glenn Research Center who writes science fiction in his spare time
2. The idea of a cloud city on Venus was first proposed in 1960s science fiction novels, and since then, scientists have explored the concept in more detail
3. The ships would float 50 kilometers (31 miles) above the planet’s surface
4. It’s the hottest planet in the solar system, with surface temperatures reaching 465 o C (870 o F)—plenty hot enough to melt lead
5. " 50 km above the surface, Venus has air pressure of approximately 1 bar and temperatures in the 0°C to 50°C range, a quite comfortable environment for humans
6. A TV camera on the Soviet Venera 13 lander that parachuted to the surface in 1982 transmitted it
7. Last week Landis shared with us his ideas for using a solar powered airplane to study Venus
8. What Landis proposes is creating floating cities on Venus where people could live and work, as well as study the planet below
9. If the sulfuric rain didn’t ruin your day, the immense atmospheric pressure (~92x the amount felt on Earth’s surface) and heat (up to 900° F, enough to melt lead) would crush you
10. But up about 50 kilometers above the surface, Landis says the atmosphere of Venus is the most Earth-like environment, other than Earth itself, in the solar system
