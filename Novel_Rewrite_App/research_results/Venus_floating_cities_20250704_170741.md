## Key Facts

1. p����p��wRJ���:����M��I�!mZ�4�<���37
2. A TV camera on the Soviet Venera 13 lander that parachuted to the surface in 1982 transmitted it
3. " 50 km above the surface, Venus has air pressure of approximately 1 bar and temperatures in the 0°C to 50°C range, a quite comfortable environment for humans
4. Our atmospheric chemistry is closest to Mars out of all the planets in the solar system, and its average temperature isn’t unreasonably cold ( -63 o C ) either
5. It’s also shrouded in a very dense atmosphere with clouds of toxic sulphuric acid, and its crushing surface pressure is around 90 times that of ours

7. The ships would float 50 kilometers (31 miles) above the planet’s surface
8. NASA is currently doing just that; floating a concept that could one day see a 30-day manned mission to Earth’s closest planetary neighbor

10. What Landis proposes is creating floating cities on Venus where people could live and work, as well as study the planet below
