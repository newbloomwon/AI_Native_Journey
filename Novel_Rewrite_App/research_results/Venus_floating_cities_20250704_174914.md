Colonizing Venus With Floating Cities By Nancy Atkinson - July 16, 2008 at 11:42 AM UTC | Space Exploration Seemingly, people in the space community have a tendency to push the boundaries of thought about all the possibilities that await us in the universe.  Case in point: Geoffrey Landis.  Landis is a scientist at NASA's Glenn Research Center who writes science fiction in his spare time.

## Key Facts

1. The idea of a cloud city on Venus was first proposed in 1960s science fiction novels, and since then, scientists have explored the concept in more detail
2. Marissa Hughes March 1, 2023 March 2, 2023 / It could be easier – and potentially more sustainable – to inhabit a cloud city in the dense atmosphere of Venus rather than on the dry surface of Mars
3. Whatmore Venus’s atmospheric conditions at higher altitudes ( ~50 kilometers ) are more similar to an Earth-like gravity and pressure than on the surface
4. Our atmospheric chemistry is closest to Mars out of all the planets in the solar system, and its average temperature isn’t unreasonably cold ( -63 o C ) either
5. If the sulfuric rain didn’t ruin your day, the immense atmospheric pressure (~92x the amount felt on Earth’s surface) and heat (up to 900° F, enough to melt lead) would crush you
6. As described by IEEE , the robotic version would be 31 meters long, whereas the crewed vehicle would be almost 130 meters in length
7. It’s the hottest planet in the solar system, with surface temperatures reaching 465 o C (870 o F)—plenty hot enough to melt lead
8. Courtesy NASA The Magellan probe orbited Venus from 1990 to 1994 and peered through the clouds: this image was created by emitting and re-detecting cloud-penetrating radar
9. It’s also shrouded in a very dense atmosphere with clouds of toxic sulphuric acid, and its crushing surface pressure is around 90 times that of ours
10. Standing on the planet’s surface, you would feel slightly lighter (with ~90% of Earth’s gravity) and see a thick shroud of sulfuric clouds obscuring the dry, rocky plains before you
