## Key Facts

1. " 50 km above the surface, Venus has air pressure of approximately 1 bar and temperatures in the 0°C to 50°C range, a quite comfortable environment for humans
2. As described by IEEE , the robotic version would be 31 meters long, whereas the crewed vehicle would be almost 130 meters in length
3. The idea of a cloud city on Venus was first proposed in 1960s science fiction novels, and since then, scientists have explored the concept in more detail
4. Landis is a scientist at NASA's Glenn Research Center who writes science fiction in his spare time
5. Last week Landis shared with us his ideas for using a solar powered airplane to study Venus
6. But up about 50 kilometers above the surface, Landis says the atmosphere of Venus is the most Earth-like environment, other than Earth itself, in the solar system
7. Courtesy NASA The Magellan probe orbited Venus from 1990 to 1994 and peered through the clouds: this image was created by emitting and re-detecting cloud-penetrating radar
8. p����p��wRJ���:����M��I�!mZ�4�<���37
9. Our atmospheric chemistry is closest to Mars out of all the planets in the solar system, and its average temperature isn’t unreasonably cold ( -63 o C ) either
10. Marissa Hughes March 1, 2023 March 2, 2023 / It could be easier – and potentially more sustainable – to inhabit a cloud city in the dense atmosphere of Venus rather than on the dry surface of Mars
