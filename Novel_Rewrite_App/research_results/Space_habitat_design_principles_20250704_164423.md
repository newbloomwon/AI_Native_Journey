Science & Technology Cities on asteroids? It could work—in theory Lindsey Valich | Senior Communications Specialist December 8, 2022 SHARE Facebook Share on Facebook X/Twitter Share on Twitter LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Cities on asteroids? It could work—in theory SHARE Facebook Share on Facebook X/Twitter Share on Twitter LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn In what they deem a “wildly theoretical” paper, Rochester researchers imagine covering an asteroid in a flexible, mesh bag made of ultralight and high-strength carbon nanofibers as the key to creating human cities in space.  (University of Rochester illustration / Michael Osadciw) Rochester scientists use physics and engineering principles to show how asteroids could be future viable space habitats.  This past year, Jeff Bezos launched himself into space, while Elon Musk funded a space flight for a non-astronaut crew.  Space collaborations between government and private entities, including Musk’s SpaceX and Bezos’s Blue Origin have become increasingly common.  But with the recent emergence of the so-called “New Space” movement, aerospace companies are working to develop low-cost access to space for everyone, not only billionaires.
