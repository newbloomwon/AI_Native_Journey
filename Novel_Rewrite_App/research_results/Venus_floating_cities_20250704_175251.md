Colonizing Venus With Floating Cities By Nancy Atkinson - July 16, 2008 at 11:42 AM UTC | Space Exploration Seemingly, people in the space community have a tendency to push the boundaries of thought about all the possibilities that await us in the universe.  Case in point: Geoffrey Landis.  Landis is a scientist at NASA's Glenn Research Center who writes science fiction in his spare time.

## Key Facts

1. But up about 50 kilometers above the surface, Landis says the atmosphere of Venus is the most Earth-like environment, other than Earth itself, in the solar system
2. Courtesy NASA The Magellan probe orbited Venus from 1990 to 1994 and peered through the clouds: this image was created by emitting and re-detecting cloud-penetrating radar
3. Standing on the planet’s surface, you would feel slightly lighter (with ~90% of Earth’s gravity) and see a thick shroud of sulfuric clouds obscuring the dry, rocky plains before you
4. Landis is a scientist at NASA's Glenn Research Center who writes science fiction in his spare time
5. Last week Landis shared with us his ideas for using a solar powered airplane to study Venus
6. It’s also shrouded in a very dense atmosphere with clouds of toxic sulphuric acid, and its crushing surface pressure is around 90 times that of ours
7. The ships would float 50 kilometers (31 miles) above the planet’s surface
8. NASA is currently doing just that; floating a concept that could one day see a 30-day manned mission to Earth’s closest planetary neighbor
9. It’s the hottest planet in the solar system, with surface temperatures reaching 465 o C (870 o F)—plenty hot enough to melt lead
10. Marissa Hughes March 1, 2023 March 2, 2023 / It could be easier – and potentially more sustainable – to inhabit a cloud city in the dense atmosphere of Venus rather than on the dry surface of Mars
