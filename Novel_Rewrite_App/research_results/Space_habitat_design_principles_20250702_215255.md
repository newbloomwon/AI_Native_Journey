Science & Technology Cities on asteroids? It could work—in theory Lindsey Valich | Senior Communications Specialist December 8, 2022 SHARE Facebook Share on Facebook X/Twitter Share on Twitter LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Cities on asteroids? It could work—in theory SHARE Facebook Share on Facebook X/Twitter Share on Twitter LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn In what they deem a “wildly theoretical” paper, Rochester researchers imagine covering an asteroid in a flexible, mesh bag made of ultralight and high-strength carbon nanofibers as the key to creating human cities in space.  (University of Rochester illustration / Michael Osadciw) Rochester scientists use physics and engineering principles to show how asteroids could be future viable space habitats.  This past year, Jeff Bezos launched himself into space, while Elon Musk funded a space flight for a non-astronaut crew.  Space collaborations between government and private entities, including Musk’s SpaceX and Bezos’s Blue Origin have become increasingly common.  But with the recent emergence of the so-called “New Space” movement, aerospace companies are working to develop low-cost access to space for everyone, not only billionaires.

## Key Facts

1. O’Neill, "The Colonization of Space," in Space Manufacturing Facilities , A-5
2. Since then, TV shows and movies including Star Trek and books such as Orson Scott Card’s 1985 novel Ender’s Game have depicted O’Neill cylinder-like habitats populated with human beings
3. This work constitutes the bulk of our research portfolio and the 40-plus projects underway across MIT
4. But are space cities feasible in reality? And, if so, how? According to new research from University of Rochester scientists, our future may lie in asteroids
5. The theme of SpaceVision, SEDS’ 2020 international conference, was “Beyond Earth: Humans as an Interplanetary Species
6. The Stanford Torus was proposed during the 1975 NASA Summer Study, conducted at Stanford University, with the purpose of speculating on designs for future space colonies
7. ” A spinning space metropolis In 1972 NASA commissioned physicist Gerard O’Neill to design a space habitat that could feasibly allow humans to live in space
8. Personally, I am in the business of selling ideas, and found these books both a treasure trove and a toolkit
9. [2021] Design of Supporting Systems for Life in Outer Space: A Design Perspective on Space Missions Near Earth and Beyond By Annalisa Dominoni
10. Scott A rendering of the Stanford Torus interior, a space habitat designed to house 10,000 to 140,000 permanent residents, by Don Davis for NASA
