Colonizing Venus With Floating Cities By Nancy Atkinson - July 16, 2008 at 11:42 AM UTC | Space Exploration Seemingly, people in the space community have a tendency to push the boundaries of thought about all the possibilities that await us in the universe.  Case in point: Geoffrey Landis.  Landis is a scientist at NASA's Glenn Research Center who writes science fiction in his spare time.

## Key Facts

1. Landis is a scientist at NASA's Glenn Research Center who writes science fiction in his spare time
2. It’s also shrouded in a very dense atmosphere with clouds of toxic sulphuric acid, and its crushing surface pressure is around 90 times that of ours
3. Whatmore Venus’s atmospheric conditions at higher altitudes ( ~50 kilometers ) are more similar to an Earth-like gravity and pressure than on the surface
4. Marissa Hughes March 1, 2023 March 2, 2023 / It could be easier – and potentially more sustainable – to inhabit a cloud city in the dense atmosphere of Venus rather than on the dry surface of Mars
5. It’s the hottest planet in the solar system, with surface temperatures reaching 465 o C (870 o F)—plenty hot enough to melt lead
6. A TV camera on the Soviet Venera 13 lander that parachuted to the surface in 1982 transmitted it
7. But up about 50 kilometers above the surface, Landis says the atmosphere of Venus is the most Earth-like environment, other than Earth itself, in the solar system
8. " 50 km above the surface, Venus has air pressure of approximately 1 bar and temperatures in the 0°C to 50°C range, a quite comfortable environment for humans
9. If the sulfuric rain didn’t ruin your day, the immense atmospheric pressure (~92x the amount felt on Earth’s surface) and heat (up to 900° F, enough to melt lead) would crush you
10. Courtesy NASA The Magellan probe orbited Venus from 1990 to 1994 and peered through the clouds: this image was created by emitting and re-detecting cloud-penetrating radar
