Colonizing Venus With Floating Cities By Nancy Atkinson - July 16, 2008 at 11:42 AM UTC | Space Exploration Seemingly, people in the space community have a tendency to push the boundaries of thought about all the possibilities that await us in the universe.  Case in point: Geoffrey Landis.  Landis is a scientist at NASA's Glenn Research Center who writes science fiction in his spare time.

## Key Facts

1. What Landis proposes is creating floating cities on Venus where people could live and work, as well as study the planet below
2. Marissa Hughes March 1, 2023 March 2, 2023 / It could be easier – and potentially more sustainable – to inhabit a cloud city in the dense atmosphere of Venus rather than on the dry surface of Mars
3. NASA is currently doing just that; floating a concept that could one day see a 30-day manned mission to Earth’s closest planetary neighbor
4. It’s also shrouded in a very dense atmosphere with clouds of toxic sulphuric acid, and its crushing surface pressure is around 90 times that of ours
5. Last week Landis shared with us his ideas for using a solar powered airplane to study Venus
6. As described by IEEE , the robotic version would be 31 meters long, whereas the crewed vehicle would be almost 130 meters in length
7. But up about 50 kilometers above the surface, Landis says the atmosphere of Venus is the most Earth-like environment, other than Earth itself, in the solar system
8. Our atmospheric chemistry is closest to Mars out of all the planets in the solar system, and its average temperature isn’t unreasonably cold ( -63 o C ) either
9. Standing on the planet’s surface, you would feel slightly lighter (with ~90% of Earth’s gravity) and see a thick shroud of sulfuric clouds obscuring the dry, rocky plains before you
10. Courtesy NASA The Magellan probe orbited Venus from 1990 to 1994 and peered through the clouds: this image was created by emitting and re-detecting cloud-penetrating radar
