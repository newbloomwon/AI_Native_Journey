Colonizing Venus With Floating Cities By Nancy Atkinson - July 16, 2008 at 11:42 AM UTC | Space Exploration Seemingly, people in the space community have a tendency to push the boundaries of thought about all the possibilities that await us in the universe.  Case in point: Geoffrey Landis.  Landis is a scientist at NASA's Glenn Research Center who writes science fiction in his spare time.

## Key Facts

1. It’s also shrouded in a very dense atmosphere with clouds of toxic sulphuric acid, and its crushing surface pressure is around 90 times that of ours
2. If the sulfuric rain didn’t ruin your day, the immense atmospheric pressure (~92x the amount felt on Earth’s surface) and heat (up to 900° F, enough to melt lead) would crush you
3. Landis is a scientist at NASA's Glenn Research Center who writes science fiction in his spare time
4. The ships would float 50 kilometers (31 miles) above the planet’s surface
5. The idea of a cloud city on Venus was first proposed in 1960s science fiction novels, and since then, scientists have explored the concept in more detail
6. Last week Landis shared with us his ideas for using a solar powered airplane to study Venus
7. Our atmospheric chemistry is closest to Mars out of all the planets in the solar system, and its average temperature isn’t unreasonably cold ( -63 o C ) either
8. As described by IEEE , the robotic version would be 31 meters long, whereas the crewed vehicle would be almost 130 meters in length
9. It’s the hottest planet in the solar system, with surface temperatures reaching 465 o C (870 o F)—plenty hot enough to melt lead
10. Standing on the planet’s surface, you would feel slightly lighter (with ~90% of Earth’s gravity) and see a thick shroud of sulfuric clouds obscuring the dry, rocky plains before you
