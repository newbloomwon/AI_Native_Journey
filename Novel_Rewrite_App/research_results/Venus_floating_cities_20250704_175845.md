Colonizing Venus With Floating Cities By Nancy Atkinson - July 16, 2008 at 11:42 AM UTC | Space Exploration Seemingly, people in the space community have a tendency to push the boundaries of thought about all the possibilities that await us in the universe.  Case in point: Geoffrey Landis.  Landis is a scientist at NASA's Glenn Research Center who writes science fiction in his spare time.

## Key Facts

1. NASA is currently doing just that; floating a concept that could one day see a 30-day manned mission to Earth’s closest planetary neighbor
2. A TV camera on the Soviet Venera 13 lander that parachuted to the surface in 1982 transmitted it
3. Landis is a scientist at NASA's Glenn Research Center who writes science fiction in his spare time
4. If the sulfuric rain didn’t ruin your day, the immense atmospheric pressure (~92x the amount felt on Earth’s surface) and heat (up to 900° F, enough to melt lead) would crush you
5. Marissa Hughes March 1, 2023 March 2, 2023 / It could be easier – and potentially more sustainable – to inhabit a cloud city in the dense atmosphere of Venus rather than on the dry surface of Mars
6. " 50 km above the surface, Venus has air pressure of approximately 1 bar and temperatures in the 0°C to 50°C range, a quite comfortable environment for humans
7. It’s the hottest planet in the solar system, with surface temperatures reaching 465 o C (870 o F)—plenty hot enough to melt lead
8. The ships would float 50 kilometers (31 miles) above the planet’s surface
9. Courtesy NASA The Magellan probe orbited Venus from 1990 to 1994 and peered through the clouds: this image was created by emitting and re-detecting cloud-penetrating radar
10. As described by IEEE , the robotic version would be 31 meters long, whereas the crewed vehicle would be almost 130 meters in length
