#### Step 3.1: Reaction Selection (30 seconds)
**User Action**: Click dropdown "Select Reaction Type"
**Expected Result**: Dropdown opens showing reaction options
**User Action**: Click "SN2 Reaction (Nucleophilic Substitution)"
**Expected Result**: 
- Info panel populates with reaction description
- Chemical equation appears: Nu⁻ + R-LG → R-Nu + LG⁻
- 3D molecules appear in canvas
- Play button becomes active

**Narration**: "Let's start with a classic SN2 reaction - nucleophilic substitution."

#### Step 3.2: Read Context (30 seconds)
**User Action**: Point to info panel text
**Narration**: "The description explains this is a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution where the nucleophile attacks the molecule, displacing the leaving group in a single step."

#### Step 3.3: Initial Animation (1 minute)
**User Action**: Click "Play" button
**Expected Result**: 
- Smooth 3D animation begins
- Nucleophile approaches carbon center
- Leaving group departs
- Animation completes and loops

**Narration**: "Watch how the nucleophile approaches from the backside, the carbon inverts its configuration, and the leaving group departs. This happens in one concerted step."

#### Step 3.4: Step Control Demo (1 minute)
**User Action**: Click step control circles (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
**Expected Result**: Animation jumps to specific steps
**Narration**: "You can control the pace - pause at any critical moment to examine the transition state."

**User Action**: Click "Freeze at step start" checkbox
**Expected Result**: Animation pauses at beginning of each step
**Narration**: "Perfect for classroom instruction where you need to explain each phase."

#### Step 3.5: Zoom Control Demo (1 minute)
**User Action**: Click "Zoom In" button 3 times
**Expected Result**: Camera moves closer to molecules
**Narration**: "Get up close to see bond formation and breaking."

**User Action**: Click "Reset" button
**Expected Result**: Camera returns to default position
**Narration**: "Easy reset to optimal viewing angle."

### Phase 4: Electron Visualization Feature (3 minutes)

#### Step 4.1: Toggle Electrons (1 minute)
**User Action**: Click "Show Electrons" button
**Expected Result**: 
- Button changes to "Hide Electrons"
- Electron pairs become visible on molecules
- Animation shows electron movement

**Narration**: "This is where it gets powerful - watch the electrons. See how the nucleophile's lone pair attacks the carbon while the C-LG bond breaks."

#### Step 4.2: Electron Movement Analysis (2 minutes)
**User Action**: Click through steps 1-5 with electrons visible
**Expected Result**: Clear visualization of electron flow
**Narration**: 
- Step 1: "Nucleophile approaches with its lone pair"
- Step 2: "Electron density begins to shift"
- Step 3: "Transition state - maximum bond strain"
- Step 4: "New bond forms, old bond breaks"
- Step 5: "Products with inverted stereochemistry"

### Phase 5: Comparison Demo - Different Reaction Type (3 minutes)

#### Step 5.1: Switch to E2 Reaction (1 minute)
**User Action**: Click dropdown, select "E2 Elimination"
**Expected Result**: 
- New reaction loads
- Different molecular arrangement
- Updated description and equation

**Narration**: "Let's compare with an elimination reaction - completely different mechanism."

#### Step 5.2: Quick E2 Demo (2 minutes)
**User Action**: Click "Play" with electrons visible
**Expected Result**: Base abstracts proton, double bond forms
**Narration**: "Notice the concerted but different process - base removes proton while leaving group departs, forming a double bond."

**User Action**: Use step controls to highlight key differences
**Narration**: "Same starting materials, different conditions, completely different outcome."

### Phase 6: Educational Value Demonstration (1.5 minutes)

**User Action**: Toggle between reactions quickly
**Narration**: "Students can compare mechanisms side-by-side, understanding why different conditions lead to different products."

**User Action**: Demonstrate smooth zoom and rotation
**Narration**: "Every angle is explorable - no detail is hidden."

**User Action**: Show step-by-step control
**Narration**: "Self-paced learning - students control their understanding."

### Phase 7: Closing & Call to Action (0.5 minutes)

**Narration**: "This transforms abstract chemistry into visual understanding. Students see what textbooks can only describe."

**User Action**: Leave application running for audience exploration
**Narration**: "Try it yourself - select any reaction, control the playback, explore the mechanisms."
